Circuit Connections:
	Sure, I can help you with listing out the connections for the Arduino code and the circuit diagram that I have generated for you. Here is the list of connections:
â€¢	Connect the Arduino digital pin 2 to the clock (pin 1) of the first 7474 IC
â€¢	Connect the Arduino digital pin 3 to the reset (pin 4) of both 7474 ICs
â€¢	Connect the Arduino digital pins 4, 5, and 6 to the Q0, Q1, and Q2 outputs (pins 5, 6, and 9) of the first 7474 IC
â€¢	Connect the Q2 output (pin 9) of the first 7474 IC to the data (pin 2) of the second 7474 IC
â€¢	Connect the Q0, Q1, and Q2 outputs (pins 5, 6, and 9) of the second 7474 IC to the anodes of the LEDs
â€¢	Connect the cathodes of the LEDs to the ground (GND) of the Arduino through 220 ohm resistors
â€¢	Connect the VCC (pin 14) and GND (pin 7) of both 7474 ICs to the 5V and GND of the Arduino
I hope this list helps you understand how to connect the Arduino pins to the 7474 ICs and the LEDs. ðŸ˜Š
