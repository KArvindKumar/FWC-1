1. connect the Arudino 5v to the bread bord "+"connect the Arudino Gnad to the bread bord "-".
2. "2"and "3" are the input so connect it to the Arudino of "2" and "3" pins.
3. connect an output pin 13 to the positive side(Long side) of the LED placed on the breadbord.
4. The Negative side (short side) to an resestor and connect that resistor other end to gnad.
5. now change the pin's to "+" and "-" by that the output will change as the truth table.
