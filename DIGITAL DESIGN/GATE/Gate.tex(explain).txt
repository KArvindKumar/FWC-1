There are two input
B_PIN=2
C_PIN=3
There is one output
OUT_PIN=13
Setup() this is a function that set's the input pins as input's with pull-up resistor and output pin as output.
loop() this read's value of B and C, and calculates as !B.C using this logic and writes the result to output pin.
This is an AND operator.
